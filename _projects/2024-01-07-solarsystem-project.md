## Solar System

In my CS307 Computer Graphics Final Project, I created an immersive solar system experience, featuring a dynamic display of planets and captivating particle animations. The project aimed to showcase key graphics concepts learned during the course, emphasizing hierarchical modeling, materials, lighting, user interaction, and animation.

---

### Main Features:

- **Hierarchical modeling** structures the solar system, with planets demonstrating realistic materials, lighting, and shading effects.
- **User interaction** enables exploration of the scene, while an animated planetary orbiting system and dynamic particle animations add a captivating touch.

---

### Technical Highlights:

The project utilizes Three.js, a JavaScript library for 3D graphics, to render an interactive and visually appealing solar system. The HTML file incorporates OrbitControls for user interaction and includes textures and materials for realistic rendering. The animation and dynamic elements are achieved through WebGL rendering, demonstrating proficiency in core graphics concepts."
