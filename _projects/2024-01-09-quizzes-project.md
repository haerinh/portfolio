### Project Overview

"Fun Facts" is an interactive quiz application that allows users to test their knowledge across various topics through a clean and intuitive web interface. Designed for educational purposes, the application leverages JavaScript and jQuery for dynamic content manipulation, enabling users to engage with multiple-choice questions conveniently grouped by topic. Each quiz question comes with a set of radio buttons for options, and a grading button to immediately provide feedback on the user's selection. This project not only enhances learning through immediate assessment but also demonstrates effective use of modern web development techniques for real-time user interaction.

### Technical Highlights

#### JavaScript and jQuery

- **Question Class:** Utilizes the object-oriented programming (OOP) approach with the `Question` class to dynamically create question elements with radio buttons and a grading button.
- **Data Handling:** Stores quiz questions in a JavaScript array and dynamically generates question instances based on the data.
- **Event Handling:** Implements event delegation using jQuery to handle button clicks and trigger the grading process.

#### CSS Styling

- **Responsive Design:** Utilizes Flexbox and media queries to create a responsive and visually appealing design that adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Aesthetic Choices:** Incorporates pastel tones, rounded corners, and subtle gradients to enhance the overall visual appeal.
- **Class-based Styling:** Uses CSS classes such as `.correct` and `.incorrect` to dynamically highlight correct and incorrect answers.

This project showcases a blend of dynamic JavaScript functionality, jQuery event handling, and CSS styling, resulting in an interactive Fun Fact Quiz.
